# Hi, Iâ€™m Christopher (@christopherspeed)!
- I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science from Princeton University, and I'm interested in full-stack development roles.

# Projects - Here's some of what I've worked on!
- [My Princeton Senior Thesis](https://github.com/christopherspeed/comedy_thesis_editor) - A Jupyter Notebook-based interface for editing stand-up comedy videos. Built using Python, OpenCV, Jupyter Notebooks, and FFmpeg.
- [ShaderApp](https://speed-shaders.vercel.app/) - A browser application for creating and editing GLSL shaders. Built using React + Typescript, Next.js, react-three-fiber, and styled with Tailwind.
- **Thunderbolt Health** - A client-facing website for Thunderbolt Health, a startup focusing on price transparency in healthcare. Built using the Astro framework and supported by a serverless backend made using AWS.
- [ClubPrinceton](https://github.com/aabid-ism/ClubPrinceton) - A social media application for connecting with clubs and extracurricular organizations at Princeton University. I handled the entire stack for all site content, implementing a variety of React components with matching Express endpoints and database logic using MongoDB.

# Other Activities
Outside of computer science, I was previously:
- the **Emeritus Vice President** of Princeton Tower Club,
- a **Senior Liaison('23-24)/Workshop Chair ('22-23)** for Princeton's Computer Science Council,
- **Co-President** of Basement: A Student Stand-up Comedy Group,
- **Head Writer** of All-Nighter, Princeton's premier late-night talk show, 
- and **Web Director/Writer** at Princeton Tiger Magazine, Princeton's college humor magazine since 1882.
