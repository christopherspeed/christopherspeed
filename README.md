# Hi, I‚Äôm Christopher (@christopherspeed)!
- I'm a senior at Princeton University üêÖ studying Computer Science, with a focus on full-stack development.

# Projects - Here's some of what I've worked on!
- [ShaderApp](https://speed-shaders.vercel.app/) - A browser application for creating and editing GLSL shaders. Built using React + Typescript, Next.js, react-three-fiber, and styled with Tailwind.
- [Thunderbolt Health](https://www.thunderbolthealth.com/) - A client-facing website for Thunderbolt Health, a startup focusing on price transparency in healthcare. Built using the Astro framework and supported by a serverless backend made using AWS.
- [ClubPrinceton](https://github.com/aabid-ism/ClubPrinceton) - A social media application for connecting with clubs and extracurricular organizations at Princeton University. I handled the entire stack for all site content, implementing a variety of React components with matching Express endpoints and database logic using MongoDB.

# Other Activities
